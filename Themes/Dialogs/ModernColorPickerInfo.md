# Modern Color Picker Implementation

## Key Features Added

1. **Modern UI Design**
   - Rounded corners with proper padding and spacing
   - Consistent color scheme using dynamic resources
   - Visual hierarchy with section borders and headers
   - Improved layout and organization

2. **Enhanced Color Selection**
   - Fixed gradient implementation by embedding gradient definitions directly in rectangles
   - Added proper gradient rectangles instead of resource bindings
   - Improved color and hue selectors with drop shadows
   - Better handling of mouse events with separate MouseUp handlers

3. **Eyedropper Tool**
   - Screen color picking functionality
   - Magnified preview window that follows the cursor
   - Visual indicator (crosshair) for precise selection
   - Real-time color preview as you move the cursor

4. **Extended Color Information**
   - Added HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) input fields
   - Improved organization of color value inputs
   - Better visualization of current and new colors

5. **Enhanced Usability**
   - Larger standard color swatches with visual effects
   - Better button styling and consistent sizes
   - Improved visual feedback throughout the interface

## Technical Notes

- The eyedropper implementation uses WinAPI functions for precise pixel color capture
- Fixed gradient issues by directly creating the gradients in XAML rather than binding to resources
- Added proper mouse event handling for better user experience
- Implemented bidirectional conversion between RGB and HSV color spaces
